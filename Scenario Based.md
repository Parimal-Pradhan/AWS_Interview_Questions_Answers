# Real-Time AWS DevOps Interview Questions & Answers: 

Real-world questions to help you crack it.👇

1️⃣ What is the difference between CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline?

✅ AWS CodeBuild → Compiles code, runs tests, and creates artifacts.
✅ AWS CodeDeploy → Automates application deployment across EC2, Lambda, or on-prem servers.
✅ AWS CodePipeline → CI/CD service that automates the entire release process by integrating CodeBuild and third-party tools.

2️⃣ How does AWS handle container orchestration?

✅ ECS: AWS-managed service using the EC2 launch type or AWS Fargate (serverless).
✅ EKS: Fully managed Kubernetes service for running containerized workloads.

3️⃣ How does AWS Lambda fit into DevOps?

👉 AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events, making it ideal for automating CI/CD workflows, infrastructure monitoring, and log processing.

4️⃣ What is the purpose of AWS Elastic Beanstalk in DevOps?

👉 Elastic Beanstalk provides PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), automatically managing infrastructure, scaling, and deployment for applications written in Python, Node.js, Java, etc.

5️⃣ How do you implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS?

✅ Terraform → Multi-cloud, declarative, open-source.
✅ CloudFormation → AWS-native, used to define & provision AWS infrastructure.
✅ AWS CDK → Infrastructure as Code using TypeScript, Python, and other languages.

6️⃣ What is the difference between Blue-Green and Canary Deployments?

✅ Blue-Green Deployment → Deploys new code to a separate environment (Green), switches traffic once validated.
✅ Canary Deployment → Gradually shifts traffic to the new version to detect issues early.

7️⃣ How does AWS CloudWatch help in DevOps monitoring?

👉 AWS CloudWatch monitors logs, metrics, and events to detect anomalies, trigger alarms, and automate responses via Lambda or Auto Scaling.

✅ Use Case: Set up an alert for high CPU utilization on EC2, triggering an Auto Scaling event.

8️⃣ What is AWS Systems Manager, and how does it help DevOps teams?

👉 AWS Systems Manager provides centralized management for EC2, on-prem servers, and applications, enabling:
✅ Patch Management
✅ Automated Operations (SSM Run Command, State Manager)
✅ Secure Parameter Storage (AWS SSM Parameter Store)

9️⃣ How do you secure AWS DevOps pipelines?

✅ Use IAM roles & least privilege access
✅ Encrypt sensitive data using AWS Secrets Manager
✅ Enable MFA & rotate credentials regularly
✅ Monitor pipeline activities with AWS CloudTrail

🔟 What is AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)?

👉 AWS FIS allows DevOps teams to simulate failures 
(latency, CPU spikes, network disruptions) to test application resilience and improve system reliability

1. Scenario: You need to automate infrastructure deployment and management. What AWS services should you use?
- Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Implement AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD automation.
- Use AWS Config for compliance monitoring.

2. Scenario: Your team needs to deploy a new version of an application without downtime. How would you do this?
- Use AWS CodeDeploy for Blue/Green Deployment strategy.
- Implement Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to shift traffic between old and new instances.
- Leverage AWS Lambda & API Gateway for serverless rollouts.

3. Scenario: A company needs to monitor thousands of EC2 instances, track performance, and generate alerts. What AWS services should they use?
- Set up Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, logs, and alarms.
- Use AWS X-Ray for application performance tracing.
- Implement AWS Systems Manager for centralized monitoring.

4. Scenario: How do you ensure security compliance across all AWS accounts in an organization?
- Use AWS Organizations to manage multiple accounts.
- Enable AWS Security Hub for compliance monitoring.
- Implement AWS IAM Policies & GuardDuty for security threats.

5. Scenario: A company wants to automate patch management for EC2 instances. How would you do it?
- Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for automated patching.
- Implement Amazon Inspector for vulnerability assessments.
- Schedule patching during maintenance windows to avoid downtime.
