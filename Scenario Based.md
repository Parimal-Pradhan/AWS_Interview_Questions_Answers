# Real-Time AWS DevOps Interview Questions & Answers: 

Real-world questions to help you crack it.👇

1️⃣ What is the difference between CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline?

✅ AWS CodeBuild → Compiles code, runs tests, and creates artifacts.
✅ AWS CodeDeploy → Automates application deployment across EC2, Lambda, or on-prem servers.
✅ AWS CodePipeline → CI/CD service that automates the entire release process by integrating CodeBuild and third-party tools.

2️⃣ How does AWS handle container orchestration?

✅ ECS: AWS-managed service using the EC2 launch type or AWS Fargate (serverless).
✅ EKS: Fully managed Kubernetes service for running containerized workloads.

3️⃣ How does AWS Lambda fit into DevOps?

👉 AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events, making it ideal for automating CI/CD workflows, infrastructure monitoring, and log processing.

4️⃣ What is the purpose of AWS Elastic Beanstalk in DevOps?

👉 Elastic Beanstalk provides PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service), automatically managing infrastructure, scaling, and deployment for applications written in Python, Node.js, Java, etc.

5️⃣ How do you implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in AWS?

✅ Terraform → Multi-cloud, declarative, open-source.
✅ CloudFormation → AWS-native, used to define & provision AWS infrastructure.
✅ AWS CDK → Infrastructure as Code using TypeScript, Python, and other languages.

6️⃣ What is the difference between Blue-Green and Canary Deployments?

✅ Blue-Green Deployment → Deploys new code to a separate environment (Green), switches traffic once validated.
✅ Canary Deployment → Gradually shifts traffic to the new version to detect issues early.

7️⃣ How does AWS CloudWatch help in DevOps monitoring?

👉 AWS CloudWatch monitors logs, metrics, and events to detect anomalies, trigger alarms, and automate responses via Lambda or Auto Scaling.

✅ Use Case: Set up an alert for high CPU utilization on EC2, triggering an Auto Scaling event.

8️⃣ What is AWS Systems Manager, and how does it help DevOps teams?

👉 AWS Systems Manager provides centralized management for EC2, on-prem servers, and applications, enabling:
✅ Patch Management
✅ Automated Operations (SSM Run Command, State Manager)
✅ Secure Parameter Storage (AWS SSM Parameter Store)

9️⃣ How do you secure AWS DevOps pipelines?

✅ Use IAM roles & least privilege access
✅ Encrypt sensitive data using AWS Secrets Manager
✅ Enable MFA & rotate credentials regularly
✅ Monitor pipeline activities with AWS CloudTrail

🔟 What is AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS)?

👉 AWS FIS allows DevOps teams to simulate failures 
(latency, CPU spikes, network disruptions) to test application resilience and improve system reliability

1. Scenario: You need to automate infrastructure deployment and management. What AWS services should you use?
- Use AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Implement AWS CodePipeline for CI/CD automation.
- Use AWS Config for compliance monitoring.

2. Scenario: Your team needs to deploy a new version of an application without downtime. How would you do this?
- Use AWS CodeDeploy for Blue/Green Deployment strategy.
- Implement Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to shift traffic between old and new instances.
- Leverage AWS Lambda & API Gateway for serverless rollouts.

3. Scenario: A company needs to monitor thousands of EC2 instances, track performance, and generate alerts. What AWS services should they use?
- Set up Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, logs, and alarms.
- Use AWS X-Ray for application performance tracing.
- Implement AWS Systems Manager for centralized monitoring.

4. Scenario: How do you ensure security compliance across all AWS accounts in an organization?
- Use AWS Organizations to manage multiple accounts.
- Enable AWS Security Hub for compliance monitoring.
- Implement AWS IAM Policies & GuardDuty for security threats.

5. Scenario: A company wants to automate patch management for EC2 instances. How would you do it?
- Use AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for automated patching.
- Implement Amazon Inspector for vulnerability assessments.
- Schedule patching during maintenance windows to avoid downtime.

10 Real-Time AWS DevOps Interview Questions & Answers

1️⃣ How do you make an S3 bucket private while allowing access to specific users?
🔹 Use a bucket policy or IAM policy with explicit deny for s3:GetObject, allowing only specific IAM roles or users.

2️⃣ How do you establish private connectivity between two VPCs?
🔹 Use VPC Peering or AWS Transit Gateway for scalable communication between multiple VPCs.

3️⃣ What is the difference between a security group and a network ACL?
🔹 Security groups act as stateful firewalls at the instance level, while network ACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level.

4️⃣ How do you handle high availability for an EC2 instance?
🔹 Use Auto Scaling Groups with multiple AZs, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB), and EBS snapshots for backup.

5️⃣ How do you prevent accidental deletion of an S3 bucket?
🔹 Enable MFA Delete and S3 Versioning to safeguard against accidental deletions.

6️⃣ What’s the best way to securely connect an on-premises data center to AWS?
🔹 Use AWS Site-to-Site VPN for encrypted connectivity or AWS Direct Connect for dedicated, high-speed connections.

7️⃣ How do you troubleshoot an EC2 instance that’s unreachable via SSH?
🔹 Check security groups, network ACLs, route tables, and EC2 instance status checks.

8️⃣ What’s the difference between EBS and Instance Store?
🔹 EBS is persistent storage that remains after instance termination, while Instance Store is ephemeral and lost upon shutdown.

9️⃣ How do you optimize S3 costs?
🔹 Use Lifecycle Policies, Intelligent-Tiering, and enable S3 Storage Class Analysis.

🔟 How do you enforce security best practices in AWS DevOps?
🔹 Implement IAM least privilege, VPC Security Groups, AWS Config, and use AWS Security Hub for continuous monitoring.
