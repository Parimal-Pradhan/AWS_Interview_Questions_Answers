# Cost Optimization in a DevOps Environment

Company: A growing SaaS startup running its infrastructure on AWS.

Challenge: Cloud bills increased by 40% over six months due to inefficient resource allocation and unnecessary usage.

Issue 1: Over-Provisioned EC2 Instances
- The company used large EC2 instances for staging and development, running 24/7.
- Many instances were idle during non-business hours.

Solution:
- Implemented auto-scaling for production workloads.
- Scheduled automatic shutdown of non-production instances during off-hours using AWS Lambda.
- Switched to spot instances for non-critical batch processing.

Result: 30% reduction in EC2 costs.

Issue 2: High Log Storage Costs
- Application logs were stored in Amazon S3 with no retention policy, leading to terabytes of data.

Solution:
- Moved old logs to S3 Glacier for cheaper long-term storage.
- Applied lifecycle policies to auto-delete logs older than 90 days.

Result: 50% reduction in log storage costs.

Issue 3: Inefficient CI/CD Pipeline
- Every Git commit triggered a full build and test suite, consuming unnecessary compute resources.

Solution:
- Modified the pipeline to trigger builds only on changes to specific directories.
- Introduced caching for dependencies, reducing build times.
- Used self-hosted GitHub runners instead of expensive managed runners.

Result:- 40% reduction in CI/CD execution costs.

Outcome:
- After implementing these optimizations, the company reduced its AWS bill by 35% while maintaining performance and reliability.
Lesson: Small inefficiencies add up. Regular cost reviews and automation can significantly cut expenses.
